## 6a
The way I interpret this is. Given an input shaped like this;
```
abc

a
b
c

ab
ac

a
a
a
a

b
```
Where:
- Every line ending indicates a new 'user' (aoc jargon)
- Every double line ending indicates a new 'group' (aco jargon)
- And possible answers are `a...z`

Count the amount of unique occurances for any given letter per group.
I think we should be able to split by double empty lines, then groupBy character and count those groups.

Part one was quite straight forward. I'm contemplating moving to a Stack based setup as I'm unable to import modules for some reason...
