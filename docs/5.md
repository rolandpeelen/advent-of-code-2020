## 4a
Given a list of boarding passes with the following shape:
```
BFBBFFFLRR
FFBFBBBLLL
FBFBFBFLLL
BBFFFBFLLR
FBFFBBFLRR
BBFBFFFLLL
```

Get to the boarding passes given the following rules
```
Boarding passes are divided like this;
xs ys
where xs = length 7
and ys = length 3

Where F means Front
and B means Back
and L means Left
and R means Right

Amount of seats 128
Amount of rows 8
```
The xs and ys are the same description to get to a number, where the following rules are kept:
```
Take first half: F, L
Take second half: B, R
```

I think the plan should be to:
- Split the list at length 7
- Send both lists to a generic function that takes a 'first' / 'second' char
- Calculate both lists
- zip them with (is there a function like that?) (FB * 8) + . RL. Where FB is the front / back no. and RL the left to right.

split / zip

... 

So my gameplan worked, sort of. That step `Calculate both lists`, I sort of skipped as I figured it wouldn't be super nice, we're basically calculating an integer. Why instantiate a list of integers every single time if you can just keep the indexes of the left and right hand side of the list? Well, a lot of manual figuring out to round the start and finish of the list... Took me way to long... On to no. two after a :coffee:. 

## 4b
4b comprises of finding a missing id in the middle of the list. I think we can assume that if the seats at the very front, or very back are missing, the whole row will be missing. I think I better start with just having a look at the outcome of data when I don't zip them but instead return the pairs of (Row, Seat)
