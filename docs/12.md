## 12a

```
F10
N3
F7
R90
F11
```

Given the list of instructions where;
- N means North
- S means South
- E means East
- W means West
- L means Turn Left
- R means Turn Right
- F means forward in current direction

Determine the position of a ship at the end of the instructions.
The N/S/E/W is rather trivial. By keeping an x / y value of the position and
making the ship move. ...
Now that I think about it, if we not only keep track of an x / y, but also
which direction the ship is facing (in deg), with a function to turn deg into
a heading, we should be good. We can decouple the two. Ship starts facing east 
so we start at 90.

I think we could do this all in one pass, encapsulated in a parser. But I
also think 12b will have more elaborate stuff in there. So perhaps we keep it separate.

First one was solved exactly like this.
