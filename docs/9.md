## 9a

Given a list like this:
```
35
20
15
25
47
40
62
55
65
95
102
117
150
182
127
219
299
277
309
576
```

Find the number where:
`n26 === and possible sum of two numbers from n0 - n25`

Going through the list splitting it and making a set of all possible sums is a valid thing to do given the size of the dataset. There should only be 25*25 calculations, so worst case scenario (the last item is the one), we'll do 1000 * 625 sums. Should be fine.
