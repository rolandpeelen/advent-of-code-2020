This seems akin to some assembly instructions to me. 

```
nop +0
acc +1
jmp +4
acc +3
jmp -3
acc -99
acc +1
jmp -4
acc +6
```

## Thoughts
This program states to be an infinite loop and we should return before the program
is ran a second time. Ie. Every action can only be done once. While I've never
written anythin of the sorts, I see a couple of approaches. All of them start
with parsing the list of instructions to some (Action Instruction) type.

- We could find a way to sort the instructions so they become sequential, then use a stack or just fold them (would immediatly remove our need for the infinte state).
- We could just recursively go through the list (map with an index) keeping an index of the next instruction to go to. Solving infinity by:
  - Keeping a list of instructions, it seems we can just keep the first one given the example
  - Giving the function a new list, updating that current action to (Done) and maching on that.

After some thinking I think that recursion should work;
- Parse the list of instructions to a `Map Index (Action, Instruction)`
- Recursively go through the map, updating the map itself with a `Done` action when we're done. When we hit one of those, we've made it round.
