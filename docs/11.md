This was relatively easy. Convert the list of strings to a data type where I can have access by a certain index (and we keep the index), so we get sort of a grid system. Then go through them one-by-one, finding the adjecent items as we go along.
Adding recursion was relatively easy.

Found:
- New language server for Haskell provids supernice abstractions / redundant functions (for where to use `<$>` instead of `fmap` etc.)
