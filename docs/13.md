## 13a

Given the following;
```
939
7,13,x,x,59,x,31,19
```

Where line one represents the earliest minute since 0 where you can leave
And line two represents a minute interval at which the busses leave.
Find the earliest bus;
So that would mean;

```
== 939
== 939 `mod` 7 == 1, 939 `mod` 13 == 3, x, x 939 `mod` 59 == 54, 939 `mod` 31 == 9, 939 `mod` 19 == 8
== 1, 3, x, x 54, 9, 8

This will give us the number of minutes that have passed since the last one. So if we subtract that value from the original value, we get;

== 7 - 1, 13  - 3, x, x, 59 - 54, 31 - 9, 19 - 8
== 6, 10, x, x, 5, 22, 11
```
If we take the lowest item there, multiply it by the bus id, we should get our number.
