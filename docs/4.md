## 4a
Given a list of identities with the following properties:
```
byr (Birth Year)
iyr (Issue Year)
eyr (Expiration Year)
hgt (Height)
hcl (Hair Color)
ecl (Eye Color)
pid (Passport ID)
cid (Country ID)
```
Validate them, where cid is optional.

Example:
```
ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd
byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm

iyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884
hcl:#cfa07d byr:1929

hcl:#ae17e1 iyr:2013
eyr:2024
ecl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931
hgt:179cm

hcl:#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648
iyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in
```

### Thoughts
This at first sight seems to be a perfect opportunity to get another parser out! What's interesting to not is that the values come in in any order. I see two approaches;
- Take lines, then words, sort them, then take all the values and validate them individually for *presence only* (ie. remove cid if there is one, then check the length). However, there could be a spanner in the works when they start including other fields than the 8 declared.
- Write parsers, then combine them into a single one that populates a data field. If we do that over the list, we should get a list of valid passwords.

The input is quite malformed. So simply using `lines` won't work. I will have to break up the string by empty lines and remove the eol characters myself...
