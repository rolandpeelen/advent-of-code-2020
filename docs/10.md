## 10a
I'm not learning much from my earlier note on making a plan before executing. So 10a was done before writing this.
Basically, I just sorted the list, since you had to use all of them, just calculate the difference between the element and the next one, making sure to add a `0` to the head, and `val[length] + 3` to the last item. Then count 1's and threes.

## 10b
Given the list of deduced differences;
```
[1,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,3,1,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,3,1,3,1,1,1,1,3]
```
We can state the following;
`[1]` = 1 permutation (2 ^ 1-1) = 1
`[1, 1]` == `[2]` == 1 + 1 steps (2 ^ 2-1) = 2
`[1a, 1b, 1c]` == `[2, 1]` == `[2, 1]` == `[1, 2]` 3 extra permutations (2 ^ 3-1) = 4
`[1a, 1b, 1c, 1d]` == `[2, 1c, 1d]` == `[1a, 2(a), 1d]` == `[1a, 2(b), 1d]`== `[3, 1]` == `[3, 1]` == `[1, 3]` (we can't go to 4)

I.e. Any sequence of 1s = `2^(n-1)`. So if we take the diff of 1s, we should be able to calculate the total permutations.
