## 7a
Conceptually this one is pretty easy;
Given a bag that contains other bags `(outer, [inner])` check how often you can have a golden bag in the list of inners, where for every inner you can create an outer;
`(outer, [(outer, [(outer, inner)])])`... 

## 7b
This seems to be the inverse...

## Concluding
Not a whole lot of comments up there. Mainly because my brain was crackling and popping trying to grapple the recursion. While conceptually it's not s√∫perhard. Doing it in code was kind of a pain.
In the first one it was simply counting the occurances, so I made a simple sort of lookup, where I flattened the list;
```
from:
( outer, [inner1, inner2] )

to:
(inner1, outer)
(inner2, outer)
```
That way, I could easily traverse 'up', checking for every inner if there is a relation to an outer, and if so, check for that outer (as inner) wether there is a relation to another outer. etc.

The second one was a bit tricky'er as I had to keep a count of everything. Doing a lot of mapping and filtering over nested arrays was tricky and my brain was struggling to keep up. There must have been a simpler solution to this...

The attack plan was similar for both cases. I wrote a 'simple' function that took a single item and went and did the operation once. Then I adjusted the input to add what I wanted to see from the output. I.e. in the second case, I wanted a count of how many bags and the last found bag. So I adjusted my input to `(1, "shiny gold")`. This worked nicely, because I could multiple the left hand side with the count of the other bags going deeper into the tree. But that wasn't enough, because my output would be a list, so my initial argument became `[1, "shiny gold"]`. Matching the input and output meant I could do this in a recursive way. The last hurdle came when you had to find in the same list over and over again. So I added a recursive wrapper to do so.

What I did like was that I kind of just wrote the parser like it was nothing. That was something I was struggling with a few days back, and went really well today!

-- I annotated [../7b.hs](7b) with quite some comments to it makes a bit more sense.
