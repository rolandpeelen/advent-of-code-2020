## 2A
Given a list of passwords in the following shape;
`1-3 a: abcde`
`'a-'b 'c: 'd`
check if `'c` is represented between `'a` and `'b` times in `'d`.

### Thoughts
This seems fairly straight forward. I should be able to fold over the list, checking for each value wether its valid and if so, increment. We need to do some splitting / string mangling, that should be interesting.

So what seemed quite straight forward turned out to be a bit of a pain. I tried doing some string splitting magic, and tried doing some regex (the latter required some packages), but I eventually opted to go for 'parsec' and got that to work reasonably well...
